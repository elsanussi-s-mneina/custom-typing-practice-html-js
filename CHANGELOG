2021-01-15 version 1.0
Could not find previous version of similar application, so I decided to write a new one.
Wrote a new one with a textbox where the user can edit what characters to be tested; a second textbox where the computer places text for the user to type; a third textbox where the user attempts to type whatever is in the second textbox.

If the user makes 3 mistakes at the end of their text, they have to start typing the text from scratch again. If the user types the full text completely, the computer generates a new random text based on the character set.

The textbox containing the character set initially contains the lowercase and uppercase latin characters. A button is included that will add punctuation.

2021-01-15 version 1.01
- added support for inserting a tab character, 2 spaces, or 4 spaces when a tab key is pressed (only into the practice text area).

2021-01-15 version 1.02
- told user which character they got wrong, and which character they confused it with.
- congratulated the user when they typed the whole text correctly.
